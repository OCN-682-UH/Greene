# Data Analyses

```{r analyese}

# this is a huge dataset! let's filter it down.  
# filter year >= 2020  

year <- democracy_data %>% # data set of choice
  filter(year >= "2020") # we want to only see the entries from 2020 and beyond.

glimpse(year) # check it out

```

```{r clean}

# Data Clean  
# Let us see what countries have female monarchs as of 2020  

female_monarch <- year %>% # rename dataset to female_monarchs
  select(country_name, year, is_female_monarch) %>% # select focal data
  drop_na() # drop empty rows

glimpse(female_monarch)
```
# Plot  

```{r tidyplot2}

# time to plot it all!
# i want to just see the ratio between monarchies not led by/led by women are around the world.  

tidyplot2 <- female_monarch %>% # dataset of choice
  ggplot(aes(x="", 
             y=is_female_monarch, # data to plot

# Wrap-up!  
- This was my first time using such a huge data set!  
- Practiced filtering the data to reduce the data set in size  
- My first time attempting a pie chart! lol.  
- My first time using "scale_fill_manual" to manually adjust the legend and fill options.
