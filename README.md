Aloha mai,

Here is my Repository Folder for all of my R-stuff!

Each week has an associated folder, which includes the following:

1. Data: Datasets
2. Output: Plot csv and visuals
3. Script: R-studio scripts

Much mahalos for dropping in to see my progress as I further explore data visualization! ^-^
