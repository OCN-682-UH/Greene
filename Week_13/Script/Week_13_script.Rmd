# Lecture: For Loops!     

```{r}
# for loops!  
# one way to run an iterative process  
# index in statement  
# command looks like:
# for( index in sequence) {command to repeat}
```

```{r}
# using loops to read in multiple .csv files

# point to the location on the computer of the folder
CondPath<-here("Week_13", "data", "cond_data")
# list all the files in that path with a specific pattern
# In this case we are looking for everything that has a .csv in the filename
# you can use regex to be more specific if you are looking for certain patterns in filenames

# pre-allocate space for the loop  
# make an empty dataframe that has one row for each file and 3 columns

                   mean_temp = rep(NA, length(files)), # column name for the mean temperature

# Lecture: Maps!  

```{r}

# the pattern of looping over a vector.  
# map() makes a list.
# map_lgl() makes a logical vector.
# map_int() makes an integer vector.
# map_dbl() makes a double vector.
# map_chr() makes a character vector.
# map_df() makes a dataframe

# Each function takes a vector as input, applies a function to each piece, and then returns a new vector thatâ€™s the same length (and has the same names) as the input.
```


```{r}
# use a canned function that already exists


1:10 %>% # a vector from 1 to 10 (we are going to do this 10 times) %>% # the vector to iterate over
  map(rnorm, n = 15) # calculate 15 random numbers based on a normal distribution in a list
```

```{r}

# calculate the mean from each list  

1:10 %>% # a vector from 1 to 10 (we are going to do this 10 times) %>% # the vector to iterate over
  map(rnorm, n = 15)  %>% # calculate 15 random numbers based on a normal distribution in a list 
  map_dbl(mean) # calculate the mean. It is now a vector which is type "double"
```

```{r}

# make your own function  

1:10 %>% # list 1:10
  map(function(x) rnorm(15, x)) %>% # make your own function
  map_dbl(mean)
```
```{r}

# Use a formula when you want to change the arguments within the function  

1:10 %>%
  map(~ rnorm(15, .x)) %>% # changes the arguments inside the function
  map_dbl(mean)

```


```{r}

# bring in files using purrr instead of a for loop 
# point to the location on the computer of the folder

CondPath<-here("Week_13", "data", "cond_data")
files <- dir(path = CondPath,pattern = ".csv")
files
```

```{r}

# Or, we can get the full file names in one less step by doing this...  

files <- dir(path = CondPath,pattern = ".csv", full.names = TRUE)
#save the entire path name
files
```

```{r}

# read in the files  

data<-files %>%
  set_names()%>% # set's the id of each list to the file name
  map_df(read_csv,.id = "filename") # map everything to a dataframe and put the id in a column called filename
data
```

```{r}

# calculate means  

data<-files %>%
  set_names()%>% # set's the id of each list to the file name
  map_df(read_csv,.id = "filename") %>% # map everything to a dataframe and put the id in a column called filename
  group_by(filename) %>%
  summarise(mean_temp = mean(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_sal = mean(Salinity,na.rm = TRUE))
```

# Homework  
```{r}

# Homework  

# You have a set of 4 .csv files in data/homework. Each of these files is a timeseries of temperature and light data collected in tide pools in Oregon by Jenn Fields. 
# Your goal is to bring in all 4 files and calculate the mean and standard deviation of both temperature (Temp.C) and light (Intensity.lux) for each tide pool. 

# Use both a for loop and map() functions in your script. (Basically, do it twice). Due Tuesday at 1pm.
